<p><strong>How to send money using WhatsApp? </strong></p>
<p>Facebook-owned popular instant messaging app WhatsApp on Friday launched its payment services in India. WhatsApp, an in-chat feature is now available for users across the country. WhatsApp Pay is an easy to use UPI payment feature inside the messenger. While chatting, It allows users to send and receive money to their contacts. It uses UPI, a payment infrastructure built by a coalition of large banks in the country, to send and receive money. </p>



<p>The WhatsApp Pay feature was initially launched in India in 2018 but it got stuck in Beta mode in the absence of regulatory approvals by the authorities, who raised data security concerns. On Thursday, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) granted its approval to WhatsApp to expand in a graded manner with 20 million users initially.</p>



<p>&#8220;Starting today, people across India will be able to send money through WhatsApp. This secure payments experience makes transferring money just as easy as sending a message,&#8221; WhatsApp said in a tweet.</p>



<h2><strong>How to enable WhatsApp Pay on your phone?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1.</strong> Open WhatsApp messaging app</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> Go to settings and select Payments option</p>



<p><strong>3. </strong>Click Add Payment method and choose your bank</p>



<p>4. You will be asked to select your bank. </p>



<p><strong>5.</strong> After you have selected your bank, you will be asked to verify your mobile number. Click verify via SMS.</p>



<p><strong>6.</strong> Once the verification process is completed, your WhatsApp Payments set up will be completed. You can add multiple accounts in Payment Method. To do that, repeat the process and select the banks, you have an account in.</p>



<h2><strong>How to use WhatsApp Pay?</strong></h2>



<p>The &#8220;payment&#8221; option will be visible in the share file menu. Once enabled, users can send money to their contacts by entering the payment window. The WhatsApp Pay service works on the UPI method and one doesn&#8217;t need to provide bank account details like account number and IFSC code to send or receive the money. The money can also be sent to those who are not on your contact list by scanning a QR code.</p>
