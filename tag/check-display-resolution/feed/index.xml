<h2>What is my screen resolution ?</h2>
<p>The things you see on your <a href="/tag/computer-screen/"><strong>computer screen</strong></a> are comprised of millions of tiny pieces called “<a href="/tag/display-pixels/"><strong>pixels</strong></a>.” These pixels form the colors, lines, and videos you see on your monitor. Resolution is a measurement of these pixels, specifically how many there are in a grid when measured horizontally and vertically. The higher the number of pixels in the grid, the clearer or better your <a href="/tag/screen-resolution/"><strong>resolution</strong></a> is.</p>
<p>Given this rule, it’s easy to see why larger TVs and computer screens require higher resolutions to appear clear. If a low resolution is projected onto a very large screen, it will look fuzzy, not unlike the way older television shows and movies would look on a big screen TV before many of them were converted to high definition or even 4K. One way to overcome these low-resolution issues is to go with a smaller screen or monitor.</p>

<h2>How to check screen resolution ?</h2>
<p>Many times, it’s helpful to know your <a href="/tag/screen-resolution/"><strong>screen resolution</strong></a>. You can enjoy your multimedia activities much more by knowing what you have, as well as what’s possible. To check your screen resolution, use these steps in <strong>Windows 10</strong>:</p>
<ol class="rich-content-ordered-list">
<li class="list-item">Type <strong>Display Settings</strong> in the search bar from the Start Menu in the lower left corner of your screen</li>
<li class="list-item">Click to open</li>
<li class="list-item">Scroll down to the <strong>Scale and Layout</strong> section and look for the resolution drop-down box</li>
<li class="list-item">Make note of the resolution listed. Ideally, it should be two numbers with <strong>(Recommended)</strong> listed after it</li>
<li class="list-item">To adjust the resolution, select another choice from the drop-down box. You should only see what’s appropriate for your PC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjusting your resolution may be necessary when getting a new monitor or upgrading your video card. <a href="/tag/screen-resolution/">Screen resolution</a> is also the first thing you should check when experiencing any display issues. It’s a simple fix for a number of common visual problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is the highest screen resolution?</h2>
<div>The highest ever resolution made may be the yet-to-be-released 8K, which is coming to TVs and home theaters in the coming years. Currently, most people recognize 4K to be the pinnacle of resolution. For laptops and computer monitors, the most reliable threshold is 3840 x 2160 resolution.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>How to find your screen resolution in 3 easy steps ?</h2>
<p>If you need to determine your computer&#8217;s screen resolution is in order to run a particular type of business software, you can do so from inside the <strong>Windows</strong> operating system.</p>
<div class="section clearfix">
<ol>
<li>Right-click on an empty section of your Windows desktop.</li>
<li>Click the &#8220;Screen Resolution&#8221; option that appears in the list.</li>
<li>View the numbers shown next to the &#8220;Resolution:&#8221; heading on this screen. The first number is the number of horizontal pixels Windows is trying to display. The second number is the number of vertical pixels. If you see a &#8220;(Recommended)&#8221; label after this number, it is because Windows believes this screen resolution is the best one available to match your monitor or display.</li>
</ol>
