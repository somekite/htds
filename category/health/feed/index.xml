<p>Ants in your house can be a big nuisance. Here are some really effective <a href="/tag/home-remedies-to-get-rid-of-ants/">home remedies to get rid of ants</a>. They are simple and cost effective.</p>
<p>Where there is one ant visible, there are likely thousands more nearby. If an ant infestation occurs in your home, you’ll want to solve the problem fast.</p>
<h3>Are ants harmful to human ?</h3>
<p>According to the National Wildlife Federation, there are more than <a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Ants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12,000 species</a> of ants around the world. Most of these ants are harmless to human.</p>
<p>But ants can carry bacteria, making them potential transmitters of disease or infection. <em>Monomorium</em> ants can carry pathogenic bacteria, which can be dangerous to people. The pharaoh ant, which is a type of <em>Monomorium</em> ant, may be a cause of bronchial asthma and respiratory allergies.</p>
<p>We all hate how ants enter our houses, especially in summers. They live in our house like they own it; well there are some ways that may help to get rid of the ants; one of them is to keep your house absolutely clean. We suggest some amazing home remedies that you&#8217;d need right now to ensure there are no ants in your house. Here&#8217;s how you can get rid of ants at home.</p>
<h2><strong>How to get rid of ants without killing them</strong></h2>
<h3>This is how to <a href="/tag/get-rid-of-ants-permanently/">get rid of ants permanently</a> / Easy ways to repel ants</h3>
<h3> 1. Ground black or red pepper</h3>
<p>Black or red (cayenne) pepper is a natural ant deterrent, as the insects appear to find the smell irritating.</p>
<p>To use this method, sprinkle pepper around baseboards and behind appliances. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is a safe way to help keep ants at bay.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Chalk</strong></h3>
<p>One of the home remedies to get rid of ants is to use chalk. Chalk contains calcium carbonate, which helps in keeping ants away. Spray some powdered chalk in the areas that are the entry points of ants or draw a line of chalk at the entrance. In order to keep ants of your house, draw chalk lines so that these bugs don&#8217;t enter.</p>
<h3>3. Diatomaceous earth (silicon dioxide)</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is a type of silica made of fossilized remains of aquatic organisms called diatoms (a type of plankton).</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth isn’t a poison. It kills ants and other bugs by absorbing the oils in their skeletons, which dries them out.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Lemons</strong></h3>
<p>Squeeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter. You can also wash your floors with water that has a little lemon juice added to it. Ants apparently don&#8217;t like the smell of lemon juice so they will keep away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330.jpg" alt="How to get rid of ants: Squeeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter" width="620" height="330" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330.jpg 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<h3>5. Glass cleaner &#8211; liquid detergent</h3>
<p>Ants leave a scented pheromone trail behind when they walk, which acts as a map. This method can remove the scent and deter the ants from reentering your home.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mix glass cleaning spray with liquid detergent (dish soap) into a clean spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray the mixture on areas where ants seem to enter from or congregate around.</li>
<li>After spraying, wipe down the area leaving a light residue.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps as often as needed.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>6. Salt</strong></h3>
<p>Spreading salt near nooks and corners from where ants enter the house will help keeping ants away. Table salt is one of the best and the cheapest ways to get rid of ants naturally. Use ordinary table salt not health boosting rock salt. All you need to do is to boil water and add a large amount of salt to it, stirring it until dissolves. Pour into a spray bottle and spray where you think ants tend to enter from.</p>

It's not only frustrating to have ants running around, but a colony of ants can actually cause a lot of damage as well. It is pretty unhygienic to have ants inside your home. Some ant varieties like Fire and Harvester can even bite humans. Carpenter ants, on the other hand, are known to damage building materials. Ants inside the house certainly contaminate the food. They carry bacteria which they can transfer to food or an open wound. Ants have a diverse family; they are around 12,000 different varieties of ants. We all hate how ants enter our houses, especially in summers. They live in our house like they own it; well there are some ways that may help to get rid of the ants; one of them is to keep your house absolutely clean. We suggest some amazing home remedies that you'd need right now to ensure there are no ants in your house. Here's how you can get rid of ants at home. Here's how to get rid of ants at home:This is how to get rid of ants permanently-1. ChalkOne of the home remedies to get rid of ants is to use chalk. Chalk contains calcium carbonate, which helps in keeping ants away. Spray some powdered chalk in the areas that are the entry points of ants or draw a line of chalk at the entrance. In order to keep ants of your house, draw chalk lines so that these bugs don't enter. While it not clear as to why this line stops the ants from coming inside, but it is surely effective. Make sure you make the line in a way that is out of reach of any child in the house. 2. LemonsSqueeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter. You can also wash your floors with water that has a little lemon juice added to it. Ants apparently don't like the smell of lemon juice so they will keep away. Anything sour and bitter may keep the ants away, but any sugar is ants' best friend. So ensure you do not keep anything sweet that may attract the ants in some way or the other. Keep your kitchen slab absolutely clean and place the peels right there.

Spread this paste around entry points of ants and wipe it afterwards. You can also place orange peels on the kitchen slab or wherever you think these ants may enter from.

<h3>7. Tea tree oil</h3>
<p>Like peppermint oil, tea tree oil can be an effective ant deterrent. To use this method, complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 5 to 10 drops tea tree essential oil with 2 cups water in a clean plastic spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray the mixture around the house where you typically see ants. Alternatively, you can saturate cotton balls with the mixture and place them around your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the scent is too strong, try making a mixture of tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and water.</p>
<p>Like most essential oils, keep tea tree oil out of reach of pets.</p>
<h3><strong>8. White Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>Ants can&#8217;t bear the smell of white vinegar. Prepare a solution of equal amounts of water and white vinegar. Add a few drops of essential oil to it and shake well. Store this solution and sprinkle it at the points from where the ants enter. Repeat this once daily. Again, this solution may not kill the ants, but definitely keep them away from entering the no-entering zone.</p>

<h3>9. Coffee grounds</h3>
<p>Brewed coffee grounds have been found to detract ants. Try sprinkling the freshly brewed coffee grounds on disposable surfaces (such as index cards) and leaving them in areas where ants congregate, such as pet bowls.</p>
<p>You can also place the grounds on windowsills. The grounds may lose their potency once they’re dry, so make sure to change often.</p>
<h3>10. Check your houseplants</h3>
<p>Check your houseplants for swarms of ants, which might indicate nests underneath the soil. Discard any plants that appear to be infested.</p>
<p>To stop ants from making homes in your plants, surround the soil with citrus rinds from lemons or oranges.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Peppermint</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint is an insect repellent, which can help you get rid of ants. Ants don&#8217;t like the smell of peppermint and are likely to avoid areas that contain traces of it. Peppermint has a strong fragrant that cannot be tolerated by the ants, which keep them away from entering the home. Prepare a mixture of 10 drops of peppermint essential oil and a cup of water and sprinkle it wherever you find ants. Repeat this twice a day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1162" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/peppermint-oil_620x350.jpg" alt="How to get rid of ants: Peppermint is an insect repellent, which can help you get rid of ants" width="620" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/peppermint-oil_620x350.jpg 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/peppermint-oil_620x350-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<h3>12. Keep the outdoors outside</h3>
<p>Keep your yard clean of debris. Cut off any vines or vegetation that touches or leans onto the exterior walls of your house and windows that can make it easier for ants to enter your home.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Cinnamon</strong></h3>
<p>Put cinnamon and cloves on the entrance of the house and the areas from where you think the ants can enter. This a good method to also keep your house smelling fresh and earthy. Cinnamon is often regarded as an effective DIY ant control option. It is believed that cinnamon acts as a natural repellent as ants can&#8217;t stand strong smell.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350.jpg" alt="How to get rid of ants: Put cinnamon and cloves on the entrance of the house" width="625" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350.jpg 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>14. Eliminate ant entrances</h3>
<p>Figuring out how ants are entering your home can help you eliminate an ant infestation and prevent a future one. Check your home for cracks in the walls and holes near floorboards and radiators. You can seal cracks or treat them with ant repellent. Also, check for rips in window screens that require mending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to stop kitchen ants</h2>
<p>The kitchen, offering proximity to an ample food supply, is often the place that most often attracts ants and other pests. To discourage ants from being in the kitchen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean kitchen surfaces and floors every day.</li>
<li>Wash dishes immediately after using them.</li>
<li>Rinse pet food bowls after your dog or cat eats.</li>
<li>Use natural repellents (see examples above) to detract ants and remove the pheromone scent.</li>
<li>Store food properly in sealed containers or bags that lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ants are common invaders of homes across the United States and are mostly harmless. They can be hard to get rid of, but it is possible to repel and eradicate ants over time using the natural methods described above. Commercial products are also available to help kill or detract these pests.</p>
<p>Keeping your home clean and removing possible places for ants to enter and hide can prevent future infestations.</p>

lead to burnout, which can have serious consequences. Think of burnout as stress taken to another level.</p>
<p>Because so many of us frequently feel stressed, it can be hard to recognize when the line has been crossed. True burnout is different from feeling overextended. Feeling exhausted when you begin working is a red flag.</p>
<h2>What to do to prevent burnout ? Avoid stress before its late</h2>
<p>Living at a burnout level of sustained stress can lead to serious health consequences, including problematic sleep patterns, digestion woes and even a greater risk for depression, heart problems, diabetes and weight gain.</p>
<p>Before the stress in your life ramps up to that level, know that experts say there are proactive steps you can take to <a href="/tag/burnout-prevention-tips/">prevent burnout</a>:</p>
<h2>How to prevent burnout from work</h2>
<h3>Look for meaning at work</h3>
<p>We can tolerate stress longer if we believe we’re doing something purposeful and worthwhile. We are more likely to experience chronic, burnout-inducing stress when something seems out of our control, against our will or totally meaningless. Try to identify ways in which even the smallest of your daily tasks contributes to the lives of others. Take stock of what’s on your plate. If you can, cut or outsource one or two of those things that don’t personally give you meaning.</p>
<h3>Look for meaning outside of work</h3>
<p>If you’re struggling to make your work meaningful, prioritizing life outside of work might be especially beneficial. Research published in BMC Medicine shows that people more likely to experience a greater sense of engagement when on the job are those with a hobby—the ultimate burnout buffer.</p>
<h3>Try to separate work and home/outside life</h3>
<p>With boundaries blurring between work and non-work these days, there are some tactics individuals can use. Try turning off work email notifications on your phone, using separate email accounts for work and personal life and setting up boundaries — physical and temporal — between work and personal life, especially if you work from home.</p>
<h3>Don’t neglect yourself</h3>
<p>Neglecting your diet or eating fast foods or comfort foods can become a way of dealing with stress, but it will rob your body and brain of nutrients necessary to facilitate energy and regulate moods. Physical activity is essential to shaking out stress hormones too. Movement is the most natural evolutionary response to our body’s stress. While you don’t have to run away from a mountain lion these days, even light movement helps ‘complete’ the stress cycle, flushing stress hormones out of the bloodstream.</p>
<h3>Recognize when it has become too much</h3>
<p>Talk to your supervisors when you feel your job should be more manageable, rewarding, and under your control. It is very common for superiors to continue to increase tasks over time. If we don’t communicate our needs or limitations, they may be overlooked. If you don’t expect things will improve, consider changing jobs or even careers.</p>
<h2>Burnout Therapy / Treatment</h2>
<p>If you do feel burnt out, therapy can help you process work-related stress and learn coping strategies, and it can teach you to communicate with your employer and set healthy boundaries. The <a href="/tag/burnout-therapy/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> is especially effective for dealing with workplace burnout.</p>

<h2>How to Boost your Immunity &#8211; naturally / Strengthen your Immune System</h2>
<p>There are many factors affecting the <a href="/tag/boost-immune-system/">immune system</a> that we can’t do anything about—ageing weakens our immune function, for example, and we have individual genetic differences that affect how we deal with disease. Malnutrition or physical immobility also impair our immunity.</p>

<h2>How to improve immunity / Tips to boost immunity</h2>
<p>The certain lifestyle changes can improve the body’s ability to fight illness and infection. Our immune function is incredibly complex.</p>
<p>The human <strong>immune system</strong> include antibodies, organs, proteins and enzymes. There are also lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, which include natural killer cells and memory cells.  Others are instruments for figuring out how to defend against bugs we encounter for the first time, called adaptive immunity.</p>
<p><a href="/tag/how-immune-system-works/"><strong>Immunity works</strong></a> best when we support our general health. Here are eight <strong>practical approaches</strong> that that are proven to show some results.</p>
<h3>1. Watch what you eat</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1022" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-1024x683.jpg" alt="Watch what you eat" width="600" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-640x427.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-75x50.jpg 75w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><a href="/tag/inflammation/">Inflammation</a>, a chemical cascade that’s a critical part of our immune response, also has a dark side. When it’s helping, inflammation traps viruses and bacteria by triggering fluid and swelling. It also aids in healing tissues by calling for a cleanup crew of specialized white blood cells called phagocytes. But inflammation is also triggered by glucose and fats, and if it’s constant, it can wreak havoc on your body—causing health problems such as diabetes, liver disease and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Refined carbs, like white flour, and sugar-sweetened drinks, such as colas, have long been linked to higher levels of inflammation in the body, even if the mechanisms aren’t fully understood. A cookie or a piece of candy or cake once in a while isn’t going to impact the immune system, but if highly processed foods have a bigger place on your plate than whole foods like fruits and vegetables, then honestly, you won’t feel good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Take your shots</h3>
<p>When it comes to powering up the immune system, vaccines are the most important breakthrough in history. Even before <a href="/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>, vaccinations against diseases like flu and measles were saving four to five million lives a year, according to the World Health Organization. Vaccines don’t fix all problems, but they’re profoundly effective. A <a href="/tag/covid-19-vaccination/">vaccine</a> provides a training session for our adaptive immunity, showing it how to fight an invader it’s never seen before. Traditionally, a weakened or killed virus component that can’t make us sick is injected—but some modern vaccines instead contain instructions for our own bodies to make harmless proteins that look similar to the virus. After the vaccine, you’ll have antibodies already made, so when you see the bug, you’re pre-armed and ready. Researchers are developing drugs to try to boost innate immunity, as well. A natural infection may produce a similar effect as a vaccine, but it’s not as safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Get moving</h3>
<p>People without much mobility, or those who never exercise, have less resistance to bugs. Regular moderate <a href="/tag/physical-activity/">physical activity</a>, on the other hand, optimizes immune function. And it doesn’t take much. Those with inactive lifestyles has a higher risk of hospitalization, while people who exercised, even a bit, are more likely to get better on their own.</p>
<p>Walking and running stimulate the production of B and T lymphocytes in the bones. Avoid going to extremes, though; some research shows that prolonged, marathon-style physical exertion may disrupt our normal immune function. Aim for 10 to 30 minutes of exercise every day to get the immune benefits. If you have a chronic condition that makes this amount challenging, just do as much as you comfortably or safely can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Breathe fresh air</h3>
<p>Time spent outdoors gives you a break from indoor air, where infectious bugs may circulate, but it also has benefits for your immune function. A bout of sunlight during the day improves your sleep rhythm at night and allows your body to produce essential <a href="/tag/vitamin-d/">vitamin D</a>. And it may do even more than that: in 2016, researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center demonstrated that the sun’s rays increased the activity of T cells.</p>
<p>The very act of going outdoors invariably leads to getting some exercise, and it’s even been shown that exposure to natural environments reduces stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Drink more water, and less alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol negatively affects the immune system in a variety of ways. Excessive drinkers, for example, can have a higher risk of pneumonia and other lung illnesses. They also take longer to recover from injuries and infections.  Alcohol can often take the place of the water that helps our bodies drain waste and deliver nutrients; our immune system relies on both processes.</p>
<p>Carbonated water is as good as regular water for hydration—even the flavoured ones, if they contain natural flavours with no added sugar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Harness your mind power</h3>
<p>When a burst of fear or anxiety does what it’s designed to do, our bodies are flooded with hormones that help us fight or flee—by raising our heart rate and blood pressure to circulate oxygen, for instance. This is called the sympathetic response. Afterwards, our parasympathetic response kicks in, slowing our heart rate and relaxing our bodies.</p>
<p>But chronic stress—from financial worries, from a loved one’s health scare—means those hormones keep building and circulating, which is unhealthy. Chronic stress can sap our defences and destroy immune cells.</p>
<p>Any break from constant stress will help. Fill your life with opportunities to get away from anxiety, by pushing yourself into positive places. Sing, dance or laugh. Make Tuesday night a comedy night. Do karaoke with your family.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to take time out to feel gratitude for whatever you appreciate in your life: a cuddly cat, a good-news medical-test result, the view from your window. “It’s a way of countering the negative things that jump into your mind with something more positive.”</p>
<p>You can also train yourself to induce physical relaxation in your body. Try deep breathing or, better yet, do an online search for guided relaxation and learn how to clench and release muscle groups.</p>
<h3>7. Nurture your relationships</h3>
<p>Positive social connections have been linked to reduced chronic stress, lower inflammation and a stronger resistance to disease, while loneliness and isolation have the opposite association.</p>
<p>But it can be extra tough, during a pandemic, to strengthen our friendships and cultivate supportive networks. Get creative: if you’re not a fan of video chats but have safety concerns about indoor visiting, plan outdoor gatherings with your pals or have get-togethers that are snack-free so the masks can stay on. Positive interactions trigger the release of endorphins, which calm down the sympathetic nervous response; social connections also stimulate our natural killer cells.</p>
<p>If people are putting things in your face that make you feel anxious, ‘unfriend’ them and get them off your news feed.</p>
<h3>8. Hit the hay</h3>
<p>A consistently good sleep of seven to eight hours each night lowers our risk of infection and chronic inflammation. On top of that, it even improves our response to vaccines.</p>
<p>Just like exercise, sleep affects immunity in ways that are many and varied. Unfortunately, people tend to have more trouble sleeping after about age 55 because their body clocks don’t work as well, and they may need to try harder to make improvements.</p>
<p>Part of sleeping right is having a set schedule, at least five days a week. If your sleep pattern is erratic, simply wake up at the same time every day—and you’ll eventually want to go to sleep at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Take steps to improve your sleep hygiene (ensuring your bedroom is dark, cool and quiet, for example) or investigate your options for help, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. This approach addresses the sources of your insomnia and can be highly effective after just four to eight sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6 Signs You Need More Than a Boost</h2>
<p>Sometimes a weak immune response is a red flag for more serious medical conditions or other problems. If you experience any of the following, speak with your GP:</p>
<ul>
<li>You fall ill too often</li>
<li>You have recurring digestive issues, like a sore stomach or diarrhoea.</li>
<li>You get unusual illnesses that your friends and family members don’t catch.</li>
<li>Scrapes and cuts take a long time to heal.</li>
<li>You seem to catch new bugs before you’ve recovered from the previous ones.</li>
<li>Your allergy symptoms wear you down more than usual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pulse Oximetry : Purpose, uses, Procedure, Readings</h2>
<h3>How to check oxygen level in corona / check Oxygen saturation (SpO2) level</h3>
<p><a href="/tag/pulse-oximetry/">Pulse oximetry</a> is a noninvasive and painless test. The pulse oximeter measures your <a href="/tag/oxygen-saturation-level/">oxygen saturation level</a>, or the oxygen levels in your blood. It can detect efficiency of oxygen carried to organs like heart, legs and the arms.</p>
<p>The <a href="/tag/pulse-oximeter-device/">pulse oximeter</a> is a small, clip-like device. It attaches to a body part, like toes or an earlobe. We just have to put it on a finger. A critical care setting like emergency rooms or hospitals often use the oximeter. Some doctors, such as pulmonologists, may use it in office.</p>
<h3>Pulse oximeter normal range</h3>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc"><b>Normal pulse oximeter readings</b> usually <b>range</b> from 95 to 100 percent. <b>Values</b> under 90 percent are considered low.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="css-0">
<h3>Pulse Oximetry purpose and uses</h3>
<p>The purpose of pulse oximetry is to check how well your heart is pumping oxygen through your body.</p>
<p>It monitors the health of individuals with any type of condition that can affect blood oxygen levels, especially while they’re in the hospital. These conditions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="/category/health/copd/">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a></li>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="/category/health/asthma/">asthma</a></li>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="/category/health/pneumonia/">pneumonia</a></li>
<li>lung cancer</li>
<li><a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="/category/health/anemia/">anemia</a></li>
<li>heart attack or heart failure</li>
<li>congenital heart defects</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of different common use cases for pulse oximetry, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess how well a new lung medication is working</li>
<li>evaluate whether someone needs help breathing</li>
<li>evaluate how helpful a ventilator is</li>
<li>monitor oxygen levels during or after surgical procedures that require sedation</li>
<li>determine how effective supplemental oxygen therapy is, especially when treatment is new</li>
<li>assess someone’s ability to tolerate increased physical activity</li>
<li>evaluate whether someone momentarily stops breathing while sleeping — like in cases of sleep apnea — during a sleep study</li>
</ul>
<h3>How pulse oximetry works</h3>
<p>During a pulse oximetry reading, a small clamp-like device is placed on a finger, earlobe, or toe. Small beams of light pass through the blood in the finger, measuring the amount of oxygen. It does this by measuring changes of light absorption in oxygenated or deoxygenated blood. This is a painless process.</p>
<p>The pulse oximeter will thus be able to tell you your oxygen saturation levels along with your heart rate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="css-0">
<h3>Procedure steps</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry may be used in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you have a pulse oximeter for home use.</p>
<p>The pulse oximetry process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most commonly, a clip-like device will be placed on your finger, earlobe, or toe. You may feel a small amount of pressure, but there is no pain or pinching. In some cases, a small probe may be placed on your finger or forehead with a sticky adhesive. You may be asked to remove your fingernail polish if it’s being attached to a finger.</li>
<li>You’ll keep the probe on for as long as needed to monitor your pulse and oxygen saturation. When monitoring physical activity capabilities, this will be during the extent of the exercise and during the recovery period. During surgery, the probe will be attached beforehand and removed once you’re awake and no longer under supervision. Sometimes, it will only be used to take a single reading very quickly.</li>
<li>Once the test is over, the clip or probe will be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-0">
<h3>Pulse oximetry readings</h3>
<p>Pulse oximetry is typically a fairly accurate test. This is especially true when using high-quality equipment found in most medical offices or hospital settings. It consistently provides results within a 2-percent difference either way of what it truly is. If your reading was 82 percent, for example, your true oxygen saturation level may be anywhere from 80 to 84 percent. However, the quality of the waveform and assessment of the individual must be considered. Factors such as movement, temperature, or nail polish can impact the accuracy.</p>
<p>Typically, more than 89 percent of your blood should be carrying oxygen. This is the oxygen saturation level needed to keep your cells — and your body — healthy. While having an oxygen saturation below this temporarily is not believed to cause damage, repeat or consistent instances of lowered oxygen saturation levels may be damaging.</p>
<p>An oxygen saturation level of 95 percent is considered normal for most healthy individuals. A level of 92 percent indicates potential <a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/hypoxemia/basics/definition/sym-20050930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hypoxemia</a>, or deficiency in oxygen reaching tissues in the body.</p>
<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>Once the test is over, your care provider will have the readings available immediately. This will help them determine if other testing or treatment is necessary. If you’re evaluating how successful your oxygen supplementation therapy is, for example, a reading that’s still on the low side might indicate the need for more oxygen.</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will be able to tell you what the next steps are. If you’re using pulse oximetry at home, they’ll let you know how often to take your readings and what to do if they go above or below certain levels.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</div>
<p>Pulse oximetry is a quick, noninvasive, and completely painless test. It comes with no risks aside from potential skin irritation from the adhesive used in some types of probes.</p>

<h3>How to cope with side effects after getting covid vaccine</h3>
<p>Although unlikely, if you experience emergency warning symptoms at any time after receiving your COVID-19 vaccine, call 9-1-1 immediately. Emergency warning symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face, or any other sudden and severe symptom.</p>
<p>Common side effects include pain at the injection site, fever, body aches and headaches. These reactions are frequent (and indicate that your body is making an immune response to the vaccine) and should go away within 1-2 days, with the exception that swollen lymph nodes may persist up to about 10 days.</p>
<p>Swollen lymph nodes may be seen on routine screening mammograms for up to a month after vaccination. If you are due for a screening mammogram soon and it will not result in undue delays, you may consider scheduling it 4-6 weeks after your second vaccine appointment.</p>
<h3>Help identify and minimize mild side effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use an ice pack or cool, damp cloth to help reduce redness, soreness and/or swelling at the place where the shot was given.</li>
<li>A cool bath can also be soothing.</li>
<li>Drink liquids often for 1-2 days after getting the vaccine.</li>
<li>Take an over the counter pain reliever unless you have any specific contraindication.</li>
</ul>
<p>For symptoms that are severe or last 72 hours or more contact your regular clinician or Primary Care Provider.</p>
<h3>When to be tested for COVID-19 infection</h3>
<p>The following symptoms suggest COVID-19 infection and are not common vaccine side effects</p>
<ul>
<li>New loss of smell or taste</li>
<li>Cough or shortness of breath</li>
<li>Congestion/sore throat/runny nose/conjunctivitis (red eye)</li>
<li>Nausea/vomiting or diarrhea.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have one or more of these symptoms, stay at home, and call the Call Center or your regular clinician to schedule a COVID test. If you do have a positive COVID-19 test between your first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine, you should wait 10 days from when you first tested positive and be fully recovered before getting your second dose. You should still get the second dose.</p>
<p>You must continue to follow the advice of public health officials whether you are vaccinated or not: Wear your mask in public, ensure hand hygiene, and practice social distancing.</p>

<h4>Easy-to-make <a href="/tag/healthy-refreshers/">healthy refreshers</a> drinks to keep you hydrated in summer heat</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s that time of the year when stepping out even for a few minutes is punishing—you come back dripping with sweat, craving something cool to quench your thirst. Be it aam panna or <a href="/tag/thandai/">thandai</a> or a glass of <a href="/tag/cold-coffee/">cold coffee</a>, a refreshing beverage can get you back on your feet almost immediately. And if you are pressed for time or too tired to make them from scratch, you can stock up on instant versions too.</p>
<h3>SYRUPS</h3>
<p>Concentrated fruit juice or syrups are a quick and easy option that is both flavourful and energy boosting. Add a spoonful or two of the syrup to cold water or chilled milk and you are done. And there are plenty of flavours to choose from: orange, lemon, pineapple, rose—the list is endless.</p>
<h3>AAM PANNA</h3>
<p>Made with raw green mangoes, aam panna is a delicious and nutritious old favourite. Other than helping you fight dehydration, this sweet and tangy drink is packed with vitamins B1 , B2 and C, as well as essential minerals such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. You can stock ready-to-drink bottles or use an instant aam panna mix to make yourself a quick refreshing drink any time of the day.</p>
<h3>THANDAI</h3>
<p>While you may associate thandai with Holi, this drink is a super-nutritious cooler that’s perfect for a hot day too. Literally meaning ‘cold’, thandai is prepared using a mixture of almonds, pepper, rose petals, cardamom, vetiver seeds, saffron, milk, fennel seeds and sugar.</p>
<h3>COCONUT WATER</h3>
<p>High in water content and packed with vitamins and minerals, coconut water should be your go-to drink before you step out on a hot day or right after you are back indoors. It instantly replenishes fluids lost through sweat without adding many calories. This also makes it the ideal post-workout drink. Coconut water is also great for your skin.</p>
<h3>ICED TEA</h3>
<p>Many tea enthusiasts prefer switching to the iced version of this perennial favourite during the hot months. Brew yourself a cuppa using flavoured tea leaves or go for an instant mix. Icedtea mixes are made by drying the tea leaves and then powdering them. You can make a strong or a mild cold brew based on your preference.</p>
<h3>COLD COFFEE</h3>
<p>Switch over from your regular mug of cappuccino to a tall, frothy glass of cold coffee. Besides making it the traditional way, you can also keep a few packs of cold-brew mix in your kitchen—all you need to do is add milk and ice and your chilled beverage is ready.</p>

<h4>Corona virus (COVID-19): <a href="/tag/coronavirus-home-care/">Home Care</a> &amp; <a href="/tag/covid19-precautions/">Precautions</a> guide</h4>
<p>Doctors might recommend home care if someone in your family:</p>
<ul>
<li>has coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
<li>was tested for COVID-19 and is waiting for the results</li>
<li>has flu symptoms (like a fever, cough, and sore throat)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who is sick — even if they don&#8217;t know for sure they have coronavirus (COVID-19) — should stay home unless they need medical care. This helps prevent the illness from spreading to other people.</p>
<h3>What Should We Do at Home to prevent corona virus spread ?</h3>
<p>To protect others at home, someone who is sick should:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>As much as possible, keep away from other people and pets in your home.</li>
<li>Wear a cloth face covering (or face mask, if you have one) if they must be around other people. Cloth face coverings are for use only by people older than 2 years old who are not having trouble breathing. Do not leave a child alone while they&#8217;re wearing a cloth face covering. To see how to put on and remove cloth face coverings and face masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC&#8217;s guide</a>.</li>
<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, throw the tissue away, and then wash their hands right away. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>If possible, stay in a bedroom and use a bathroom separate from other people in the home.</li>
<li>Use separate dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils and not share these with other household members. After use, run them through the dishwasher or wash with very hot soapy water.</li>
<li>Use separate bedding and towels and not share these with other household members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>If the person who is sick can&#8217;t wear a cloth face covering (or face mask), caregivers should wear one while they&#8217;re in the same room.</li>
<li>Make sure shared spaces in the home have good air flow. You can open a window or turn on an air filter or air conditioner.</li>
<li>Do not allow visitors into your home. This includes children and adults.</li>
<li>All household members should wash their hands well and often. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Wash the sick person&#8217;s clothing, bedding, and towels with detergent on the hottest temperature possible. Wear gloves when handling their laundry, if possible. Wash your hands well after handling the laundry (even if you wore gloves).</li>
<li>Every day, use a household cleaner or wipe to clean things that get touched a lot. These include doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, sink handles, counters, and phones. Keep a sick child&#8217;s toys separate from other toys, if possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To protect others in your community:</h3>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>The person who is sick should stay home unless they need medical care.</li>
<li>Other household members also should stay home. Follow instructions from your doctor, local health care department, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about who should stay home and for how long.</li>
<li>If you must go out of the house, wear a cloth face covering or face mask and keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between you and other people.</li>
<li>Tell other people who were around the sick person. Your local or state health department can help you if you aren&#8217;t sure who to notify.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Should I Call the Doctor?</h3>
<p>If the person you&#8217;re caring for seems to be getting sicker, call your doctor right away. Tell the doctor about their symptoms and whether they&#8217;ve been tested for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>If they need to go to the doctor:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>The person should wear a cloth face covering, if available.</li>
<li>Keep tissues handy in case they need to cough or sneeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to the emergency room or call 911 if the person has trouble breathing, is confused, or is very drowsy.</p>
<h3>What Else Should I Know?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re caring for someone with coronavirus or who has coronavirus symptoms, keep taking these precautions until your doctor or local health department say it&#8217;s safe to stop doing so.</p>
<p>It can get pretty lonely and boring for kids who are sick and need to stay home. While they&#8217;re separated from family, classmates, and friends, kids who feel well enough may want to:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>Talk on the phone or do a video call with family and friends.</li>
<li>Text or use other messaging apps to talk with family and friends.</li>
<li>Play online games that let them play with other kids from home.</li>
<li>Do puzzles or Legos. Keep these clean and keep separate from other toys in the house.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean items used by the sick person (such as phones and computers) before other family members use them.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> websites for up-to-date, reliable information about coronavirus.</p>

<p>Getting a <a href="/tag/contact-lens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact lens</a> stuck in your eye happens occasionally and can be uncomfortable and irritating. Here are some <strong>quick and easy solutions</strong> to get a lost or stuck contact lens out of your eye.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 no-padding blog-content-details">
<p>With a little bit of practice, you’ll be able to do it smoothly with no trouble. Here are some common questions regarding getting a <strong>lens stuck in your eye</strong> and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>Also read : <a href="/natural-remedies-to-get-rid-of-dark-spots-on-face-neck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Get Rid of Dark Spots on Face</a></p>
<h2>Why is my contact lens stuck in my eye?</h2>
<p>If you have slept in your lenses or aren’t taking good care of them, the contacts are prone to drying out, leaving the lens stuck to your eyeball. If you fall asleep in your lenses, avoid pulling the lens out right away. Drink a bit of water, rehydrate yourself and let your eye gain a bit of moisture. This will make a contact stuck in eye easier to remove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What happens if contacts get stuck in eye?</h2>
<p>The most common misconceptions about contact lenses are that they can get stuck behind your eye. A contact getting stuck behind the eye is not physically possible; your eyelid is structured to prevent any objects from going to the back of your eye.</p>
<p>A contact lens that gets stuck in the eye is usually a soft contact lens rather than a gas permeable lens. However it is possible for both to get stuck and its wise to be aware that removing a soft contact lens is very different to removing a rigid gas permeable lens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do I remove a lens that’s stuck in my eye?</h2>
<p>The first rule about how to remove a contact lens that’s stuck in your eye is not to panic; trying to pry the lens out may cause more discomfort. Wash your hands before attempting to remove the lens, to avoid getting any bacteria from your hands going in your eye and causing an infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Removing a soft contact lens from your eye</h2>
<p>Always make sure you wash your hands thoroughly before attempting to remove a stuck contact lens. If the stuck contact lens is centered on your cornea, you can rinse your eye and the contact that&#8217;s stuck with sterile saline or contact lens rewetting drops such as our comfi Drops. Once you have applied the saline solution or eye drops, close your eye and gently massage your eyelid until the lens moves.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your eyes are watering heavily, that can also make getting lenses out slightly difficult. Gently wipe your tears away, then, as always, before removing your lenses wash your hands thoroughly. Ensure your fingers are completely dry and this will make removing a stuck lens a little easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Removing a stuck gas permeable contact lens from your eye</h2>
<p>If you are wearing gas permeable lenses and they get stuck in your eye, you must avoid massaging your eyelid as this can cause abrasion to the eye. Instead, it is recommended that you use a suction cup to pull the lens of your eye gently .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can my contact lens get lost in my eye?</h2>
<p>If you think the contact lens is lost in your eye, it’s probably hiding under your upper eyelid. Simply pull it back slightly to have look and use contact lens solution to flush it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What to do if you can&#8217;t remove a stuck contact lens</h2>
<p>If the lens remains after following the above steps, we advise you to seek medical advice from a doctor or an eye specialist. This should be done as soon as possible to prevent any further problems from occurring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Top tips to prevent contacts getting lost or stuck in your eye</h2>
<p>Unless it is an extended wear lens, never sleep in your contact lenses &#8211; this can limit the oxygen flow to your cornea and dry out your eyes. In addition, you also risk infection.</p>
<p>Always clean your lenses before putting them in and taking them out. Follow a good eye care and contact lens cleaning routine if your wear monthlies or two weekly’s. Make sure you use fresh contact lens solution to prevent the spread of bacteria.</p>

<h3>Push up tips for female beginners at home</h3>
<p>In this article, we have explained how to do push-ups for female beginners to Build the muscles in your shoulders and chest with this foundational <a href="/category/exercise/">exercise</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This push up exercise targets</strong> arms, chest, core and shoulders.</p>
<h3>How to do Push ups for female beginners at home : Basic Steps</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Get down on all fours, placing your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Straighten your arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Pause, then push yourself back up.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Repeat.</p>
<p>Pushups are a simple and effective bodyweight movement that can help increase strength in your upper body and core. This <a href="/category/exercise/">exercise</a> works the pectoral muscles in your chest and the triceps. These are the muscles in the back of your upper arms.</p>
<p>You don’t need any equipment to get started with pushups. They’re suitable for <a href="/category/beginners-guide/">beginners</a> and individuals who are more advanced with exercise.</p>
<h4>Progressing to pushups</h4>
<p>While you may be familiar with standard pushups, there are many variations that may help you get started, progress, or increase difficulty.</p>
<p>Try doing a set of 10 to 15 of each exercise, rest, and then do another set of 10 to 15.</p>
<blockquote class="css-pc7ote"><p>Performing fewer pushups with correct form will be better over time than completing many with poor form.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are five pushup variations that increase in difficulty.</p>
<h3>Wall pushups</h3>
<p>Doing a standing pushup against the wall is a good starting place if you’re new to this move. By standing, you put less pressure on your joints.</p>
<ol>
<li>With your feet shoulder-width apart, stand about an arm’s length away from a wall.</li>
<li>Place your palms on the wall as you lean forward into a standing plank position. Your arms should be shoulder height and shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li>Inhale as you bend your elbows and slowly move your upper body toward the wall while keeping your feet flat on the ground.</li>
<li>Hold this position for a second or two.</li>
<li>Exhale and use your arms to push your body slowly back to your starting position.</li>
</ol>
<div class="css-1pkj7lb">
<div class="css-zr4wb2">
<h3 class="css-1v0jij4">Change it up</h3>
<div class="css-pzg5fr">
<p class="standout--body">As you get more comfortable, you can try one-handed wall pushups. Follow all the instructions above, but alternate sets by placing one arm bent behind you with the outside of your hand on the small of your back. You could also alternate keeping one arm at your side as you pushup with the other.</p>
<p>To work on stability in your shoulders, try pushups from a seated position.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sit on a bench with your palms down, arms at your side. Your feet should rest comfortably on the ground with your knees bent.</li>
<li>Using your arms, push down into your palms so that your body lifts up — still in the seated position. Your hips and butt should be just a half inch or so off the bench.</li>
<li>Lower back down to your starting position and repeat.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Kneeling pushups</h3>
<div class="css-0">
<p>Balancing on your knees instead of your feet is another good modification while you build your strength.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin in a hands and knees position with your gaze at the floor.</li>
<li>Place your hands on the ground on either side of your shoulders. Your knees should be at a comfortable distance apart.</li>
<li>Inhale as you slowly lower your elbows to bring your chest toward the ground. Be sure to keep your core muscles contracted.</li>
<li>Pause for a second in the lowered position — your chin may lightly touch the ground.</li>
<li>Exhale as you push up from the ground to your starting position.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="css-pc7ote"><p>Another way to start this pushup is to begin by laying on your stomach. Bend your knees so your feet are up in the air, then push with your hands into position on your knees.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Standard pushups</h3>
<p>Fully extending your legs increases the difficulty of this move by adding more body weight. One study showed that the “ground reaction force” or how much weight you push is 64 percent of your body weight with standard pushups. To compare, a kneeling pushup is 49 percent.</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with your chest and stomach flat on the floor. Your legs should be straight out behind you and your palms should be at chest level with the arms bent out at a 45-degree angle.</li>
<li>Exhale as you push from your hands and heels, bringing your torso, chest, and thighs off the ground.</li>
<li>Pause for a second in the plank position — keep your core engaged.</li>
<li>Inhale as you slowly lower back to your starting position.</li>
</ol>
<div class="css-1pkj7lb">
<div class="css-zr4wb2">
<div>
<h3 class="css-1v0jij4">Change it up</h3>
<div class="css-pzg5fr">
<p class="standout--body">Another great variation of the standard pushup is a pushup with hip abduction. Follow the same instructions as a standard pushup, but lift your left leg off the ground as you lower. Move it slightly further out than your hips and keep your foot flexed. Then repeat on the other side after switching legs from the plank position.</p>

</div>
<h3>Incline pushups</h3>
<p>If you want to really challenge your upper body, try incline pushups. You’ll need a stable surface on which to place your hands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your hands on the edge of the elevated surface. A bench, step, or other sturdy platform are good options.</li>
<li>Step your feet back so your legs are straight and your arms are perpendicular to your body.</li>
<li>Inhale as you slowly lower your chest to the edge of your platform.</li>
<li>Pause for a second.</li>
<li>Exhale as you push back to your starting position with your arms fully extended.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can further increase difficulty by using a medicine ball, BOSU or balance ball, or suspension trainer. Doing so will make your body work harder to stabilize, taxing muscles even more.</p>

</div>
<div class="css-0">
<h3>Comfort measures</h3>
<p>Try these methods to make your pushups more comfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform pushups on a yoga mat or similar surface instead of a bare floor.</li>
<li>When doing kneeling pushups, place a folded towel under your knees for extra cushioning.</li>
<li>To avoid wrist pain, place hands directly under shoulders with your fingers pointing directly in front of you.</li>
<li>Place palms flat on the floor versus cupping your hands. This avoids straining your hands.</li>
<li>Look down at the ground during this exercise to avoid straining your neck.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overall form</h3>
<p>When doing pushups on the ground, you’ll want to keep a flat back. Resist sagging your spine or arching it up toward the ceiling. Contracting your core muscles will help keep your form in check. Make sure to keep your movements slow and controlled versus slamming your body down too quickly. Your shoulders, hips, and ankles should be aligned.</p>
<h3>Hand positioning (narrow vs. wide)</h3>
<p>You might wonder how hand positioning might increase difficulty. Your options are holding your hands wide apart or more narrowly together. To incorporate hand positioning into your routine, try keeping your palms in front of your chest and your elbows in toward your body at the start of your pushups.</p>
<h3>Building strength</h3>
<p>Pushups may be hard to complete at first, even with modification. If you cannot complete 10 to 15, start with sets of 5 or less and build from there.</p>
<p>Increasing strength and endurance takes time but is worth the effort. Remember, performing fewer pushups with correct form will be better over time than completing many with poor form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="css-0">
<h4>The takeaway</h4>
<p>After you get the hang of pushups and are confident with your form, you may want to try a pushups challenge. Consistency is important to building strength. In the challenge, you work your way up over the course of 2 months until you can complete 100 pushups at one time.</p>
<p>Even if you’re not looking to go so extreme, incorporating this efficient body-weight exercise into your routine is sure to strengthen your upper body, back, and core to help with everyday movement.</p>
