<h3>How to cope with side effects after getting covid vaccine</h3>
<p>Although unlikely, if you experience emergency warning symptoms at any time after receiving your COVID-19 vaccine, call 9-1-1 immediately. Emergency warning symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, bluish lips or face, or any other sudden and severe symptom.</p>
<p>Common side effects include pain at the injection site, fever, body aches and headaches. These reactions are frequent (and indicate that your body is making an immune response to the vaccine) and should go away within 1-2 days, with the exception that swollen lymph nodes may persist up to about 10 days.</p>
<p>Swollen lymph nodes may be seen on routine screening mammograms for up to a month after vaccination. If you are due for a screening mammogram soon and it will not result in undue delays, you may consider scheduling it 4-6 weeks after your second vaccine appointment.</p>
<h3>Help identify and minimize mild side effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use an ice pack or cool, damp cloth to help reduce redness, soreness and/or swelling at the place where the shot was given.</li>
<li>A cool bath can also be soothing.</li>
<li>Drink liquids often for 1-2 days after getting the vaccine.</li>
<li>Take an over the counter pain reliever unless you have any specific contraindication.</li>
</ul>
<p>For symptoms that are severe or last 72 hours or more contact your regular clinician or Primary Care Provider.</p>
<h3>When to be tested for COVID-19 infection</h3>
<p>The following symptoms suggest COVID-19 infection and are not common vaccine side effects</p>
<ul>
<li>New loss of smell or taste</li>
<li>Cough or shortness of breath</li>
<li>Congestion/sore throat/runny nose/conjunctivitis (red eye)</li>
<li>Nausea/vomiting or diarrhea.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have one or more of these symptoms, stay at home, and call the Call Center or your regular clinician to schedule a COVID test. If you do have a positive COVID-19 test between your first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine, you should wait 10 days from when you first tested positive and be fully recovered before getting your second dose. You should still get the second dose.</p>
<p>You must continue to follow the advice of public health officials whether you are vaccinated or not: Wear your mask in public, ensure hand hygiene, and practice social distancing.</p>

<h4>Corona virus (COVID-19): <a href="/tag/coronavirus-home-care/">Home Care</a> &amp; <a href="/tag/covid19-precautions/">Precautions</a> guide</h4>
<p>Doctors might recommend home care if someone in your family:</p>
<ul>
<li>has coronavirus (COVID-19)</li>
<li>was tested for COVID-19 and is waiting for the results</li>
<li>has flu symptoms (like a fever, cough, and sore throat)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who is sick — even if they don&#8217;t know for sure they have coronavirus (COVID-19) — should stay home unless they need medical care. This helps prevent the illness from spreading to other people.</p>
<h3>What Should We Do at Home to prevent corona virus spread ?</h3>
<p>To protect others at home, someone who is sick should:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>As much as possible, keep away from other people and pets in your home.</li>
<li>Wear a cloth face covering (or face mask, if you have one) if they must be around other people. Cloth face coverings are for use only by people older than 2 years old who are not having trouble breathing. Do not leave a child alone while they&#8217;re wearing a cloth face covering. To see how to put on and remove cloth face coverings and face masks, clean them, or make your own cloth face covering, check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html">CDC&#8217;s guide</a>.</li>
<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, throw the tissue away, and then wash their hands right away. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>If possible, stay in a bedroom and use a bathroom separate from other people in the home.</li>
<li>Use separate dishes, glasses, cups, and eating utensils and not share these with other household members. After use, run them through the dishwasher or wash with very hot soapy water.</li>
<li>Use separate bedding and towels and not share these with other household members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>If the person who is sick can&#8217;t wear a cloth face covering (or face mask), caregivers should wear one while they&#8217;re in the same room.</li>
<li>Make sure shared spaces in the home have good air flow. You can open a window or turn on an air filter or air conditioner.</li>
<li>Do not allow visitors into your home. This includes children and adults.</li>
<li>All household members should wash their hands well and often. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>
<li>Wash the sick person&#8217;s clothing, bedding, and towels with detergent on the hottest temperature possible. Wear gloves when handling their laundry, if possible. Wash your hands well after handling the laundry (even if you wore gloves).</li>
<li>Every day, use a household cleaner or wipe to clean things that get touched a lot. These include doorknobs, light switches, toys, remote controls, sink handles, counters, and phones. Keep a sick child&#8217;s toys separate from other toys, if possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To protect others in your community:</h3>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>The person who is sick should stay home unless they need medical care.</li>
<li>Other household members also should stay home. Follow instructions from your doctor, local health care department, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about who should stay home and for how long.</li>
<li>If you must go out of the house, wear a cloth face covering or face mask and keep at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between you and other people.</li>
<li>Tell other people who were around the sick person. Your local or state health department can help you if you aren&#8217;t sure who to notify.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Should I Call the Doctor?</h3>
<p>If the person you&#8217;re caring for seems to be getting sicker, call your doctor right away. Tell the doctor about their symptoms and whether they&#8217;ve been tested for coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>If they need to go to the doctor:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>The person should wear a cloth face covering, if available.</li>
<li>Keep tissues handy in case they need to cough or sneeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to the emergency room or call 911 if the person has trouble breathing, is confused, or is very drowsy.</p>
<h3>What Else Should I Know?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re caring for someone with coronavirus or who has coronavirus symptoms, keep taking these precautions until your doctor or local health department say it&#8217;s safe to stop doing so.</p>
<p>It can get pretty lonely and boring for kids who are sick and need to stay home. While they&#8217;re separated from family, classmates, and friends, kids who feel well enough may want to:</p>
<ul class="kh_longline_list">
<li>Talk on the phone or do a video call with family and friends.</li>
<li>Text or use other messaging apps to talk with family and friends.</li>
<li>Play online games that let them play with other kids from home.</li>
<li>Do puzzles or Legos. Keep these clean and keep separate from other toys in the house.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean items used by the sick person (such as phones and computers) before other family members use them.</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CDC</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> websites for up-to-date, reliable information about coronavirus.</p>
