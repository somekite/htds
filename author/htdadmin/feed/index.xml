Here&#8217;s a look at how to activate Jio 5G network on your smartphone.</h3>
<p><a href="/tag/jio-5g-services/">Jio 5G services</a> have started rolling out in India. The telco has introduced the services in a few regions for now. This will be followed by a wider rollout in the upcoming months, but it will not be until December 2023 that the Jio 5G will be available in ‘every city, district and states of the country. Be that as it may, the <a href="/tag/jio-5g/">Jio 5G</a> will be based on a standalone network and is rated to deliver speeds up to 1Gbps. While you don’t need a new Jio SIM to use 5G, you will be required to manually enable 5G on your compatible smartphones. With that being said, in this guide, we’ll provide you with all you need to <a href="/tag/jio-5g-activation-steps/">activate Jio 5G on your smartphone</a>. So without any further ado, let’s begin.</p>
<h2>How to activate Jio 5G on your smartphone</h2>
<p>In order to use Jio 5G, you will have to enable 5G on your <a href="/tag/jio-5g-compatible-smartphones/">compatible smartphones</a>. This can be done from the phone’s settings. In case, you are not sure how follow the step-by-step guide below to activate Jio 5G on Android and iPhone.</p>
<h3>How to activate Jio 5G on Android</h3>
<p>Once Jio rolls out its 5G services in your area, 5G can be <a href="/tag/jio-5g-activation-on-android/">activated on an Android phone</a> using the following procedure.</p>
<p><img data-dominant-color="f6f5f5" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #f6f5f5;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-to-active-Jio-5G-network-on-your-smartphone-jpg.webp" alt="How to active Jio 5G network on android smartphone" width="696" height="516" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-to-active-Jio-5G-network-on-your-smartphone-jpg.webp 696w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/How-to-active-Jio-5G-network-on-your-smartphone-300x222.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Open ‘Settings’ app on your smartphone</li>
<li>Next, find and select ‘Mobile network’ or a similar setting</li>
<li>Select the Jio SIM you want to enable 5G on</li>
<li>From here, select the ‘Preferred network type’ option</li>
<li>Now select the option that says 5G</li>
<li>After following these steps, you should be getting a 5G symbol on the status bar which indicates that 5G services have been activated on your smartphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, make sure to enable mobile data and turn off Wi-Fi for the 5G symbol to appear.</p>
<div id="mAds_1"></div>
<h3>How to activate Jio 5G on iPhone</h3>
<p>iPhone users with iPhone 12 series and above can use 5G services by enabling it from the cellular settings. Following is the step-by-step process to <a href="/tag/jio-5g-activation-on-iphone/">activate Jio 5G on an iPhone</a>.</p>
<p><img data-dominant-color="d4d4d7" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #d4d4d7;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-1307" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Activate-Jio-5G-on-an-iPhone.png" alt="Activate Jio 5G on iPhone" width="356" height="405" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Activate-Jio-5G-on-an-iPhone.png 356w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Activate-Jio-5G-on-an-iPhone-264x300.png 264w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the ‘Settings’ app on your iPhone</li>
<li>Next, go the the ‘Cellular’ menu within the settings</li>
<li>From here select ‘Cellular Data Options’</li>
<li>Now to enable 5G, tap on ‘Voice &amp; Data’ option and either select ‘5G Auto’ or ‘5G On’ option</li>
<li>Your iPhone will connect to a 5G network when available and you should see a 5G symbol on the status bar which indicates 5G services have been enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>If the option to enable 5G within the settings doesn’t show up, it means the support is not live yet. Per a report, Apple has not opened 5G support on iPhones in India yet. In that case, a future iOS software update should enable the same on your iPhone.</p>
<h2>How to check if your smartphone is Jio 5G ready</h2>
<p>In order to use 5G, you need to ensure whether your current smartphone supports 5G or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do that, refer to the retail box or packaging of your smartphone and check for any ‘5G’ text either on the front along with the model name or on the backside as a label. If no such text is present, then your smartphone is not 5G compatible. However, to be double sure you can always look up Google for the same.</li>
<li>If your smartphone does support 5G, then check whether the bands mentioned on the retail box are supported by Jio’s 5G bands in your circle/city.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where there is one ant visible, there are likely thousands more nearby. If an ant infestation occurs in your home, you’ll want to solve the problem fast.</p>
<h3>Are ants harmful to human ?</h3>
<p>According to the National Wildlife Federation, there are more than <a class="content-link css-5r4717" href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Invertebrates/Ants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12,000 species</a> of ants around the world. Most of these ants are harmless to human.</p>
<p>But ants can carry bacteria, making them potential transmitters of disease or infection. <em>Monomorium</em> ants can carry pathogenic bacteria, which can be dangerous to people. The pharaoh ant, which is a type of <em>Monomorium</em> ant, may be a cause of bronchial asthma and respiratory allergies.</p>
<p>We all hate how ants enter our houses, especially in summers. They live in our house like they own it; well there are some ways that may help to get rid of the ants; one of them is to keep your house absolutely clean. We suggest some amazing home remedies that you&#8217;d need right now to ensure there are no ants in your house. Here&#8217;s how you can get rid of ants at home.</p>
<h2><strong>How to get rid of ants without killing them</strong></h2>
<h3>This is how to <a href="/tag/get-rid-of-ants-permanently/">get rid of ants permanently</a> / Easy ways to repel ants</h3>
<h3> 1. Ground black or red pepper</h3>
<p>Black or red (cayenne) pepper is a natural ant deterrent, as the insects appear to find the smell irritating.</p>
<p>To use this method, sprinkle pepper around baseboards and behind appliances. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this is a safe way to help keep ants at bay.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Chalk</strong></h3>
<p>One of the home remedies to get rid of ants is to use chalk. Chalk contains calcium carbonate, which helps in keeping ants away. Spray some powdered chalk in the areas that are the entry points of ants or draw a line of chalk at the entrance. In order to keep ants of your house, draw chalk lines so that these bugs don&#8217;t enter.</p>
<h3>3. Diatomaceous earth (silicon dioxide)</h3>
<p>Diatomaceous earth is a type of silica made of fossilized remains of aquatic organisms called diatoms (a type of plankton).</p>
<p>Diatomaceous earth isn’t a poison. It kills ants and other bugs by absorbing the oils in their skeletons, which dries them out.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Lemons</strong></h3>
<p>Squeeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter. You can also wash your floors with water that has a little lemon juice added to it. Ants apparently don&#8217;t like the smell of lemon juice so they will keep away.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330.jpg" alt="How to get rid of ants: Squeeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter" width="620" height="330" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330.jpg 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemon_620x330-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<h3>5. Glass cleaner &#8211; liquid detergent</h3>
<p>Ants leave a scented pheromone trail behind when they walk, which acts as a map. This method can remove the scent and deter the ants from reentering your home.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mix glass cleaning spray with liquid detergent (dish soap) into a clean spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray the mixture on areas where ants seem to enter from or congregate around.</li>
<li>After spraying, wipe down the area leaving a light residue.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps as often as needed.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>6. Salt</strong></h3>
<p>Spreading salt near nooks and corners from where ants enter the house will help keeping ants away. Table salt is one of the best and the cheapest ways to get rid of ants naturally. Use ordinary table salt not health boosting rock salt. All you need to do is to boil water and add a large amount of salt to it, stirring it until dissolves. Pour into a spray bottle and spray where you think ants tend to enter from.</p>

It's not only frustrating to have ants running around, but a colony of ants can actually cause a lot of damage as well. It is pretty unhygienic to have ants inside your home. Some ant varieties like Fire and Harvester can even bite humans. Carpenter ants, on the other hand, are known to damage building materials. Ants inside the house certainly contaminate the food. They carry bacteria which they can transfer to food or an open wound. Ants have a diverse family; they are around 12,000 different varieties of ants. We all hate how ants enter our houses, especially in summers. They live in our house like they own it; well there are some ways that may help to get rid of the ants; one of them is to keep your house absolutely clean. We suggest some amazing home remedies that you'd need right now to ensure there are no ants in your house. Here's how you can get rid of ants at home. Here's how to get rid of ants at home:This is how to get rid of ants permanently-1. ChalkOne of the home remedies to get rid of ants is to use chalk. Chalk contains calcium carbonate, which helps in keeping ants away. Spray some powdered chalk in the areas that are the entry points of ants or draw a line of chalk at the entrance. In order to keep ants of your house, draw chalk lines so that these bugs don't enter. While it not clear as to why this line stops the ants from coming inside, but it is surely effective. Make sure you make the line in a way that is out of reach of any child in the house. 2. LemonsSqueeze a lemon or place lemon peels in places from where the ants enter. You can also wash your floors with water that has a little lemon juice added to it. Ants apparently don't like the smell of lemon juice so they will keep away. Anything sour and bitter may keep the ants away, but any sugar is ants' best friend. So ensure you do not keep anything sweet that may attract the ants in some way or the other. Keep your kitchen slab absolutely clean and place the peels right there.

<h3>7. Tea tree oil</h3>
<p>Like peppermint oil, tea tree oil can be an effective ant deterrent. To use this method, complete the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix 5 to 10 drops tea tree essential oil with 2 cups water in a clean plastic spray bottle.</li>
<li>Spray the mixture around the house where you typically see ants. Alternatively, you can saturate cotton balls with the mixture and place them around your home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: If the scent is too strong, try making a mixture of tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and water.</p>
<p>Like most essential oils, keep tea tree oil out of reach of pets.</p>
<h3><strong>8. White Vinegar</strong></h3>
<p>Ants can&#8217;t bear the smell of white vinegar. Prepare a solution of equal amounts of water and white vinegar. Add a few drops of essential oil to it and shake well. Store this solution and sprinkle it at the points from where the ants enter. Repeat this once daily. Again, this solution may not kill the ants, but definitely keep them away from entering the no-entering zone.</p>

<h3>9. Coffee grounds</h3>
<p>Brewed coffee grounds have been found to detract ants. Try sprinkling the freshly brewed coffee grounds on disposable surfaces (such as index cards) and leaving them in areas where ants congregate, such as pet bowls.</p>
<p>You can also place the grounds on windowsills. The grounds may lose their potency once they’re dry, so make sure to change often.</p>
<h3>10. Check your houseplants</h3>
<p>Check your houseplants for swarms of ants, which might indicate nests underneath the soil. Discard any plants that appear to be infested.</p>
<p>To stop ants from making homes in your plants, surround the soil with citrus rinds from lemons or oranges.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Peppermint</strong></h3>
<p>Peppermint is an insect repellent, which can help you get rid of ants. Ants don&#8217;t like the smell of peppermint and are likely to avoid areas that contain traces of it. Peppermint has a strong fragrant that cannot be tolerated by the ants, which keep them away from entering the home. Prepare a mixture of 10 drops of peppermint essential oil and a cup of water and sprinkle it wherever you find ants. Repeat this twice a day.</p>

<h3>12. Keep the outdoors outside</h3>
<p>Keep your yard clean of debris. Cut off any vines or vegetation that touches or leans onto the exterior walls of your house and windows that can make it easier for ants to enter your home.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Cinnamon</strong></h3>
<p>Put cinnamon and cloves on the entrance of the house and the areas from where you think the ants can enter. This a good method to also keep your house smelling fresh and earthy. Cinnamon is often regarded as an effective DIY ant control option. It is believed that cinnamon acts as a natural repellent as ants can&#8217;t stand strong smell.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1163" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350.jpg" alt="How to get rid of ants: Put cinnamon and cloves on the entrance of the house" width="625" height="350" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350.jpg 625w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cinnamon-625_625x350-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<h3>14. Eliminate ant entrances</h3>
<p>Figuring out how ants are entering your home can help you eliminate an ant infestation and prevent a future one. Check your home for cracks in the walls and holes near floorboards and radiators. You can seal cracks or treat them with ant repellent. Also, check for rips in window screens that require mending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to stop kitchen ants</h2>
<p>The kitchen, offering proximity to an ample food supply, is often the place that most often attracts ants and other pests. To discourage ants from being in the kitchen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean kitchen surfaces and floors every day.</li>
<li>Wash dishes immediately after using them.</li>
<li>Rinse pet food bowls after your dog or cat eats.</li>
<li>Use natural repellents (see examples above) to detract ants and remove the pheromone scent.</li>
<li>Store food properly in sealed containers or bags that lock.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ants are common invaders of homes across the United States and are mostly harmless. They can be hard to get rid of, but it is possible to repel and eradicate ants over time using the natural methods described above. Commercial products are also available to help kill or detract these pests.</p>
<p>Keeping your home clean and removing possible places for ants to enter and hide can prevent future infestations.</p>

lead to burnout, which can have serious consequences. Think of burnout as stress taken to another level.</p>
<p>Because so many of us frequently feel stressed, it can be hard to recognize when the line has been crossed. True burnout is different from feeling overextended. Feeling exhausted when you begin working is a red flag.</p>
<h2>What to do to prevent burnout ? Avoid stress before its late</h2>
<p>Living at a burnout level of sustained stress can lead to serious health consequences, including problematic sleep patterns, digestion woes and even a greater risk for depression, heart problems, diabetes and weight gain.</p>
<p>Before the stress in your life ramps up to that level, know that experts say there are proactive steps you can take to <a href="/tag/burnout-prevention-tips/">prevent burnout</a>:</p>
<h2>How to prevent burnout from work</h2>
<h3>Look for meaning at work</h3>
<p>We can tolerate stress longer if we believe we’re doing something purposeful and worthwhile. We are more likely to experience chronic, burnout-inducing stress when something seems out of our control, against our will or totally meaningless. Try to identify ways in which even the smallest of your daily tasks contributes to the lives of others. Take stock of what’s on your plate. If you can, cut or outsource one or two of those things that don’t personally give you meaning.</p>
<h3>Look for meaning outside of work</h3>
<p>If you’re struggling to make your work meaningful, prioritizing life outside of work might be especially beneficial. Research published in BMC Medicine shows that people more likely to experience a greater sense of engagement when on the job are those with a hobby—the ultimate burnout buffer.</p>
<h3>Try to separate work and home/outside life</h3>
<p>With boundaries blurring between work and non-work these days, there are some tactics individuals can use. Try turning off work email notifications on your phone, using separate email accounts for work and personal life and setting up boundaries — physical and temporal — between work and personal life, especially if you work from home.</p>
<h3>Don’t neglect yourself</h3>
<p>Neglecting your diet or eating fast foods or comfort foods can become a way of dealing with stress, but it will rob your body and brain of nutrients necessary to facilitate energy and regulate moods. Physical activity is essential to shaking out stress hormones too. Movement is the most natural evolutionary response to our body’s stress. While you don’t have to run away from a mountain lion these days, even light movement helps ‘complete’ the stress cycle, flushing stress hormones out of the bloodstream.</p>
<h3>Recognize when it has become too much</h3>
<p>Talk to your supervisors when you feel your job should be more manageable, rewarding, and under your control. It is very common for superiors to continue to increase tasks over time. If we don’t communicate our needs or limitations, they may be overlooked. If you don’t expect things will improve, consider changing jobs or even careers.</p>
<h2>Burnout Therapy / Treatment</h2>
<p>If you do feel burnt out, therapy can help you process work-related stress and learn coping strategies, and it can teach you to communicate with your employer and set healthy boundaries. The <a href="/tag/burnout-therapy/">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> is especially effective for dealing with workplace burnout.</p>

<h2>FAQs about Casting MKV to Chromecast with Subtitles</h2>
<p><b>Does Chromecast support MKV?</b></p>
<p>No, Chromecast doesn&#8217;t support MKV natively. Chromecast supports MP4, WebM, H.264, HEVC, VP8, and VP9. If your MKV video file is encoded with H.264 or other Chromecast-supported codec formats, you can try to rename .mkv to .mp4 for casting to Chromecast. Chromecast Ultra and Chromecast with Google TV have support for HEVC codec format and HEVC Main and Main10 profiles up to level 5.4 (4K/60fps). Check for Chromecast-supported video audio formats to know more details.</p>
<p><b>MKV no subtitles through Chromecast?</b></p>
<p>Some users are encountering no subtitles showing an issue when casting MKV video files to Chromecast. Chromecast-supported subtitle formats include TTML &#8211; Timed Text Markup Language, WebVTT &#8211; Web Video Text Tracks, and CEA-608/708. Make sure the MKV subtitle format is supported by Chromecast. Also, ensure that your streaming device and Chromecast device are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p><b>VLC Chromecast MKV no video?</b></p>
<p>When casting a VLC MKV video file to TV using Chromecast, it gives a black screen. VLC only plays the audio, other app says &#8220;Chromecast doesn&#8217;t support this&#8221;. The error indicates that there&#8217;s a file compatibility issue. MKV is a container that can be encoded with a wide range of video and audio codec formats. Check if the video codec is supported for streaming by Chromecast.</p>

<h2>How to improve immunity / Tips to boost immunity</h2>
<p>The certain lifestyle changes can improve the body’s ability to fight illness and infection. Our immune function is incredibly complex.</p>
<p>The human <strong>immune system</strong> include antibodies, organs, proteins and enzymes. There are also lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, which include natural killer cells and memory cells.  Others are instruments for figuring out how to defend against bugs we encounter for the first time, called adaptive immunity.</p>
<p><a href="/tag/how-immune-system-works/"><strong>Immunity works</strong></a> best when we support our general health. Here are eight <strong>practical approaches</strong> that that are proven to show some results.</p>
<h3>1. Watch what you eat</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1022" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-1024x683.jpg" alt="Watch what you eat" width="600" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-640x427.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad-75x50.jpg 75w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a-man-making-a-salad.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p><a href="/tag/inflammation/">Inflammation</a>, a chemical cascade that’s a critical part of our immune response, also has a dark side. When it’s helping, inflammation traps viruses and bacteria by triggering fluid and swelling. It also aids in healing tissues by calling for a cleanup crew of specialized white blood cells called phagocytes. But inflammation is also triggered by glucose and fats, and if it’s constant, it can wreak havoc on your body—causing health problems such as diabetes, liver disease and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Refined carbs, like white flour, and sugar-sweetened drinks, such as colas, have long been linked to higher levels of inflammation in the body, even if the mechanisms aren’t fully understood. A cookie or a piece of candy or cake once in a while isn’t going to impact the immune system, but if highly processed foods have a bigger place on your plate than whole foods like fruits and vegetables, then honestly, you won’t feel good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Take your shots</h3>
<p>When it comes to powering up the immune system, vaccines are the most important breakthrough in history. Even before <a href="/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a>, vaccinations against diseases like flu and measles were saving four to five million lives a year, according to the World Health Organization. Vaccines don’t fix all problems, but they’re profoundly effective. A <a href="/tag/covid-19-vaccination/">vaccine</a> provides a training session for our adaptive immunity, showing it how to fight an invader it’s never seen before. Traditionally, a weakened or killed virus component that can’t make us sick is injected—but some modern vaccines instead contain instructions for our own bodies to make harmless proteins that look similar to the virus. After the vaccine, you’ll have antibodies already made, so when you see the bug, you’re pre-armed and ready. Researchers are developing drugs to try to boost innate immunity, as well. A natural infection may produce a similar effect as a vaccine, but it’s not as safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Get moving</h3>
<p>People without much mobility, or those who never exercise, have less resistance to bugs. Regular moderate <a href="/tag/physical-activity/">physical activity</a>, on the other hand, optimizes immune function. And it doesn’t take much. Those with inactive lifestyles has a higher risk of hospitalization, while people who exercised, even a bit, are more likely to get better on their own.</p>
<p>Walking and running stimulate the production of B and T lymphocytes in the bones. Avoid going to extremes, though; some research shows that prolonged, marathon-style physical exertion may disrupt our normal immune function. Aim for 10 to 30 minutes of exercise every day to get the immune benefits. If you have a chronic condition that makes this amount challenging, just do as much as you comfortably or safely can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Breathe fresh air</h3>
<p>Time spent outdoors gives you a break from indoor air, where infectious bugs may circulate, but it also has benefits for your immune function. A bout of sunlight during the day improves your sleep rhythm at night and allows your body to produce essential <a href="/tag/vitamin-d/">vitamin D</a>. And it may do even more than that: in 2016, researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center demonstrated that the sun’s rays increased the activity of T cells.</p>
<p>The very act of going outdoors invariably leads to getting some exercise, and it’s even been shown that exposure to natural environments reduces stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Drink more water, and less alcohol</h3>
<p>Alcohol negatively affects the immune system in a variety of ways. Excessive drinkers, for example, can have a higher risk of pneumonia and other lung illnesses. They also take longer to recover from injuries and infections.  Alcohol can often take the place of the water that helps our bodies drain waste and deliver nutrients; our immune system relies on both processes.</p>
<p>Carbonated water is as good as regular water for hydration—even the flavoured ones, if they contain natural flavours with no added sugar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>6. Harness your mind power</h3>
<p>When a burst of fear or anxiety does what it’s designed to do, our bodies are flooded with hormones that help us fight or flee—by raising our heart rate and blood pressure to circulate oxygen, for instance. This is called the sympathetic response. Afterwards, our parasympathetic response kicks in, slowing our heart rate and relaxing our bodies.</p>
<p>But chronic stress—from financial worries, from a loved one’s health scare—means those hormones keep building and circulating, which is unhealthy. Chronic stress can sap our defences and destroy immune cells.</p>
<p>Any break from constant stress will help. Fill your life with opportunities to get away from anxiety, by pushing yourself into positive places. Sing, dance or laugh. Make Tuesday night a comedy night. Do karaoke with your family.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to take time out to feel gratitude for whatever you appreciate in your life: a cuddly cat, a good-news medical-test result, the view from your window. “It’s a way of countering the negative things that jump into your mind with something more positive.”</p>
<p>You can also train yourself to induce physical relaxation in your body. Try deep breathing or, better yet, do an online search for guided relaxation and learn how to clench and release muscle groups.</p>
<h3>7. Nurture your relationships</h3>
<p>Positive social connections have been linked to reduced chronic stress, lower inflammation and a stronger resistance to disease, while loneliness and isolation have the opposite association.</p>
<p>But it can be extra tough, during a pandemic, to strengthen our friendships and cultivate supportive networks. Get creative: if you’re not a fan of video chats but have safety concerns about indoor visiting, plan outdoor gatherings with your pals or have get-togethers that are snack-free so the masks can stay on. Positive interactions trigger the release of endorphins, which calm down the sympathetic nervous response; social connections also stimulate our natural killer cells.</p>
<p>If people are putting things in your face that make you feel anxious, ‘unfriend’ them and get them off your news feed.</p>
<h3>8. Hit the hay</h3>
<p>A consistently good sleep of seven to eight hours each night lowers our risk of infection and chronic inflammation. On top of that, it even improves our response to vaccines.</p>
<p>Just like exercise, sleep affects immunity in ways that are many and varied. Unfortunately, people tend to have more trouble sleeping after about age 55 because their body clocks don’t work as well, and they may need to try harder to make improvements.</p>
<p>Part of sleeping right is having a set schedule, at least five days a week. If your sleep pattern is erratic, simply wake up at the same time every day—and you’ll eventually want to go to sleep at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Take steps to improve your sleep hygiene (ensuring your bedroom is dark, cool and quiet, for example) or investigate your options for help, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. This approach addresses the sources of your insomnia and can be highly effective after just four to eight sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6 Signs You Need More Than a Boost</h2>
<p>Sometimes a weak immune response is a red flag for more serious medical conditions or other problems. If you experience any of the following, speak with your GP:</p>
<ul>
<li>You fall ill too often</li>
<li>You have recurring digestive issues, like a sore stomach or diarrhoea.</li>
<li>You get unusual illnesses that your friends and family members don’t catch.</li>
<li>Scrapes and cuts take a long time to heal.</li>
<li>You seem to catch new bugs before you’ve recovered from the previous ones.</li>
<li>Your allergy symptoms wear you down more than usual.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or more advanced is:</p>

<p>This kind of pony smashing the door needs to be banned! However, many people on the Internet say that using <a href="/tag/disable_functions/">disable_functions</a> to prohibit eval is wrong! In fact, eval () cannot be disabled with disable_functions in php. ini, because eval() is a language construct and not a function.</p>
<p>eval is zend&#8217;s and is therefore not an PHP_FUNCTION function.</p>
<h3>How does php ban eval?</h3>
<p>If you want to disable eval, you can use <a href="/tag/suhosin-php-extension/">Suhosin</a>, an extension of php:<br />
After installing Suhosin, enter Suhosin. so in php. ini, and add <a href="/tag/suhosin-executor-disable_eval/">suhosin. executor. disable_eval</a> = on!</p>
<p>To sum up, the eval function of php cannot be disabled in php, so we have to use plug-ins!</p>
<h3 class="title">Use Suhosin to protect PHP application system (disable eval)</h3>
<p><a href="/tag/suhosin-php-extension/">Suhosin</a> is a <a href="/tag/web-server-protection/">protection</a> program. It was originally designed to protect servers and users from known or unknown defects in the PHP program and the PHP core. Suhosin has two independent parts, which can be used separately or in combination. The first part is a patch for the PHP core, which can resist buffer overflow or format string weakness; the second part is a powerful <strong>PHP extension</strong> that includes all other protection measures.</p>
<h3>Download Suhosin php extension</h3>
<p>Friends who use Gentoo linux or FreeBSD can find Suhosin in ports. Friends who use OpenSuSE linux, Mandriva Linux , and Debian Linux found Suhosin in the distribution package.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/download.html">http://www.hardened-php.net/suhosin/download.html</a></p>
<h2>How to install Suhosin php extension</h2>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-209 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/write-about-us-page.png" alt="how to write about us page tips examples" width="769" height="331" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/write-about-us-page.png 769w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/02/write-about-us-page-300x129.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px" /></p>
<p>The main problem you see on the average ecommerce <a href="/tag/about-us/">About Us</a> page is that it’s totally dedicated to talking about the company. An About Us page that focuses on your ecommerce brand – what a crazy idea!</p>



<p>But consider this – an About Us page isn’t <em>just</em> about you or your company. It’s about why a customer should emotionally invest in your brand. It’s about why you’re the best person to solve your customer’s problem.</p>



<p>And in the world of ecommerce, that’s what you’re doing – building trust and providing a product that solves a customer’s problem.</p>



<p>This article will go over this idea in more detail, concentrating on:</p>



<ul>
<li>The role an About Us page plays in your brand image</li>
<li>What you should and shouldn’t put on your About Us page</li>
<li>Some killer About Us page examples</li>
</ul>



<p>So let’s jump straight in!</p>



<h2>What is an About Us page</h2>



<p>An About Us page gives online shoppers insight into your brand and the people behind it. This can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>How you started your brand</li>
<li>What makes you and your brand unique</li>
<li>What are your brand values and beliefs</li>
<li>Why customers should choose you</li>
</ul>



<p>Take a look at About Us page by the yoga mat company Form. Two short paragraphs clearly define what the brand is all about – product design, sustainability, and performance.</p>



<figure class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="789" height="1024" class="wp-image-40" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example-789x1024.png" alt="" data-id="40" data-full-url="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example.png" data-link="/?attachment_id=40" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example-789x1024.png 789w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example-231x300.png 231w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example-768x997.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-example.png 1119w" sizes="(max-width: 789px) 100vw, 789px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>Telling a story on your About Us page is a great way to build trust with your potential customer.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because after reading it, your customers are more emotionally invested in your brand. If they can relate to the same values, hardships or victories that you’ve faced, you’ll start to build that rapport.</p>



<h2>Why you need an About Us page</h2>



<p>An About Us page is crucial when building relationships with your customers. If you’re still not sure whether you need this page on your website, here are a few more reasons why working on it is a good idea:</p>



<h3><strong>1. It’s popular with new visitors</strong></h3>



<p>On average, more people visit an About Us page than just about any other page on your website. Why is that?</p>



<p>People are naturally curious, and not only about the products. They also love stories and learning more about the brand itself. <strong>An About Us page quenches all three of these thirsts. </strong>So it’s crucial to create a page that capitalizes on the curiosity of your potential customers.</p>



<h3><strong>2. It shows off why you’re unique</strong></h3>



<p>No one else is running a business like yours for the same reasons that you are. Your About Us page is a great place to tell this.</p>



<p>Your unique story is what sets yourself apart from the competition and your About Page is the place you can highlight the most important difference. Besides, if people have met similar hardships and triumphs as your brand, they’ll be naturally attracted to your story.</p>



<h3><strong>3. It solidifies your brand image</strong></h3>



<p>Your About Us page is a great place to affirm exactly who you are and the way you want to be perceived by the word.</p>



<p>Goat Story creates unique coffee accessories for coffee lovers of all kinds. They’ve used a minimalistic photo shoot, with all employees dressed in similar tones and styles to highlight the brand’s image.</p>

<p>Just like their website, <a href="https://packhelp.com/how-packaging-can-increase-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product packaging</a> and website copy, there’s nothing that’s obnoxiously loud or distracting – <strong>it’s just darn good </strong>– like their product. It’s one of the many About Us page examples that somewhat uses psychology to its advantage.</p>



<p>So now that you know the effect a good About Us page can have, read on to see what you need to include into yours!</p>
<p>Also read : <a href="/how-to-sound-smarter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Sound Smarter Than You Really Are</a></p>



<h2>How to write About Us page</h2>



<p>Your About Us page can be made up of whatever you feel is the most important things to your brand. If you’re not sure where to start, here are a few suggestions that make amazing elements of any About Us Page.</p>



<p>But remember that this list is by no means extensive. Depending on your industry specifics, there may be more things that you’d like to include to assert your brand’s position in the market. The following elements are merely a handful of things that can help you do just that.</p>



<h3>1. Include a unique value proposition</h3>



<p>Find your company’s unique selling point and draw attention to it by building your About Us page around it. For example, if your unique selling point is a lenient returns policy, focus on <em>why</em> you have a lenient returns policy.</p>



<p>If your unique selling point is that your products are sourced from renewable materials, explain <em>why</em> that’s important to your brand.</p>



<p>Identifying your unique value proposition can be challenging if you didn’t start your business having it in mind. Luckily, you can consult specialists at digital marketing agencies that will help you define and introduce your products to customers by highlighting how’s your product is different and why they should care about it.</p>



<h3>2. Show your company’s faces</h3>



<p>The human eye is naturally drawn to faces. In the previous Goat Story image, I bet that you immediately started to look at the faces of people, and didn’t even notice the coffee they’re drinking.</p>



<p>By including the faces of your founders or the entire team, you can somewhat control where your reader looks. But if you’re a solopreneur, a simple profile shot of yourself should be enough to put a physical face to the company.</p>



<h3>3. Tell your brand story</h3>



<p>As mentioned earlier, your brand story is what makes you unique. There is no other story quite like yours, so it’s important that you draw attention to it.</p>



<p>Software company Morningscore does this in the form of a timeline of achievements.</p>



<figure class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-5 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="786" class="wp-image-42" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline-1024x786.png" alt="" data-id="42" data-full-url="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline.png" data-link="/?attachment_id=42" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline-1024x786.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline-300x230.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline-768x589.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline-1200x921.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-with-timeline.png 1427w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>As an ecommerce business owner, you too can use timeline storytelling. Important events in your brand’s history can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>When you had the idea of your brand</li>
<li>When you sold your first product</li>
<li>When you made your first 100 sales</li>
<li>When you hired your first employee</li>
</ul>



<p>But of course, it’s not the only way to share your story. Take a look at simple yet original brand story by makeup and skincare brand 100% Pure.</p>



<p>As you can see, brand storytelling lets you connect with your audience through shared values. It’s also one the most powerful ways to breathe life into your brand. So be honest and real about your brand and ideas behind it.</p>



<p>No matter how tempting it might be, don’t write a story that stretches over 2000 words – it’s very unlikely a customer will read it all anyway. Instead, keep it short, relevant and on-point. Avoid being too self-praising, babbling on and going offtopic.</p>



<h3>4. Share what’s happening behind the scenes</h3>



<p>In a world where the internet is as prevalent as it is (you’re using it now), transparency in manufacturing is a marketable asset <strong>–</strong> a necessity, rather than an option.</p>



<p>With many brands now appealing to certain audiences by using sustainable materials or paying above minimum wage, consumers want to know the insides of your company more than anything.</p>



<p>Embrace this, and show it off to the world.</p>



<p>Something as simple as a handful of photos of your product being manufactured can be enough to give curious customers a look into the inner workings of your company.</p>



<p>Consider using behind the scenes photos along with some text to explain the production process of your items. This leaves your reader feeling that they know exactly what they’re buying and exactly where it comes from.</p>



<h3>5. Let customers know where you are</h3>



<p>You’d be surprised to learn how much better some customers may feel after learning where your business is based. By mentioning where you’re from, you can further build trust with people of that area.</p>



<p>“Oh they’re located in Sacramento, I used to holiday there!”</p>



<p>Don’t hesitate to mention the location of both your office and where your product is shipped from because it can help erode a buyer’s reluctance to buy from you.</p>



<h3>6. Direct customer towards the next action</h3>



<p>What is the next thing you want your customers to do once they finish reading your About Us page? You probably don’t want them just left sitting there at the bottom of the page with nothing to do.</p>



<p>Create a CTA to send them back to your shop, include a contact form, or get them to sign up to your newsletter.</p>



<p>At this point – the bottom of your About Us page – is a place where your reader is active and engaged with your brand, so use it wisely.</p>



<h3>7. Consider the fold</h3>



<p>“Above the fold” is the part of the website that can be seen before a user has to scroll. As you’d imagine, this point varies depending on the devices and screen size.</p>



<p>But why you should care about it?</p>



<p>Any marketer in the world of ecommerce knows that capturing people’s attention is only part of the problem. Keeping their attention is just as important. Designing your About Us page with content that’s above the fold encourages a user to scroll down and explore the rest of the page.</p>



<p>You can find the average fold line on your website manually. Just visit your site on a wide range of devices, using different browsers and see where the page usually finishes.</p>



<h3>8. Keep your About Us page updated</h3>



<p>Once you’ve created a killer About Us page, share it with the world. But don’t forget to update it every once in a while.</p>



<p>You see, well-written About Us page can build trust in ways that no other page can. But an old, outdated page shows neglect, and as a result, destroys trust. To avoid this from happening, get into the habit of updating it every 6 months or so.</p>



<p>There are a lot more things you can do and experiment with, so don’t be afraid to try different things. You may like to put a video on your page, or have a contact form on there, too.</p>



<p>What’s best for you and your brand is something that only you can figure out, through regular testing and assessing!</p>



<h2>What not to put in an About Us page</h2>



<p>Awesome, you now know what should be included in an About Us page, but is there something you should leave out? Of course!</p>



<h3>Hype</h3>



<p>Save the hype for social media. Your About Us page is to build a rapport and bond with your customers. You don’t do that by saying how you met <a href="/contact-elon-musk-tesla-spacex-directly-email-interview/">Elon Musk</a>’s former roommate, or saying how your product is going to <em>disrupt </em>an industry.</p>



<h3>Sales pitch</h3>



<p>For the same reason that you don’t hype your brand up, you don’t use your About Us page to sell.</p>



<p>While people who are reading this page may be interested in your product, at this moment in time, they’re interested in you. Keep the focus on your brand as an entity and what makes you unique and important – not your products.</p>



<h2>Best About Us page examples</h2>



<p>Nothing can beat learning from the real-life examples. So let’s take a look at some of the best About Us pages for ecommerce brands, and see why they’re good.</p>



<p>1. Happy Socks</p>



<figure class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-7 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="980" class="wp-image-47" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors-1024x980.png" alt="" data-id="47" data-full-url="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors.png" data-link="/?attachment_id=47" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors-1024x980.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors-300x287.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors-768x735.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors-1200x1148.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-brand-colors.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you visit Abou Us page by Happy Socks?</p>



<p>Color.</p>



<p>Color is something that the Happy Socks brand is incredibly well known for. All their products are bright, eye-catching and…happy.  We love that this About Us page perfectly represents the brand.</p>



<h3>2. Flip Flop Shops</h3>



<p>Try finding new ways to introduce your brand to the world. Your About Us page is the right place to show off your company’s culture or sense of humor. </p>



<p>Flip Flop Shops specialize in selling flip flops so they can get away with using pictures of their team member’s feet instead of regular headshots. This unique way of showing off their team gives you an idea of how passionate the company is about what they do.</p>



<figure class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="849" class="wp-image-49" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example-1024x849.png" alt="" data-id="49" data-full-url="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example.png" data-link="/?attachment_id=49" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example-1024x849.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example-300x249.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example-768x637.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example-1200x995.png 1200w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/11/about-us-page-different-example.png 1357w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<h2>Do you have an About Us page?</h2>



<p>An About Us page doesn’t have to be hard work. But it should do a great job at giving the customers an insight into the inner workings of your company highlighting the whats, hows, and whys of your brand. So be honest and pick the words wisely. Most importantly, don’t forget to be human.</p>



<p>Let your creativity flow and don’t be afraid to let a little emotion come out. The more real you are, the easier it’s to connect with you and your brand. And that’s what will help your brand name stick in the head of your customers.</p>



<p>What are some of the best About Us pages that you’ve seen? Let us know in the comments!</p>

<p>For many families, the monthly <a href="/tag/child-tax-credit/"><strong>Child Tax Credit</strong></a> payments can mean the difference between financial stability and financial collapse. But for other parents, it makes more sense to stop the advance payments and claim the full credit (if any) on their 2021 tax return. If you fall into the latter group, you can opt-out of the monthly child credit payments using the IRS&#8217;s online <a class="polaris__link -is-external hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Child Tax Credit Update Portal</a>. (To access the portal, you&#8217;ll need either an existing IRS username or an <a class="polaris__link -is-external hawk-link-parsed" href="https://www.id.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID.me</a> account.)</p>
<p>To opt-out before you receive a certain <a href="/tag/ctc-monthly-payment/"><strong>monthly payment</strong></a>, you must unenrolled by at least three days before the first Thursday of the month in which that payment is scheduled to arrive (you have until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time). The full list of opt-out deadlines can be found in the table below (note that the deadlines for opting out of the first four payments have already come and gone).</p>

<h2 id="H1_js_615d58e7e2704e8d508b45c4" class="ue-c-article__headline js-headline js-headlineb">Child Tax Credit Update: A portal to update bank details and facilitate payments</h2>
<p>Families can opt out from the remaining five payments using <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:The Child Tax Credit Update Portal">The Child Tax Credit Update Portal</a> from the IRS and instead receive the credit when they file their 2021 taxes.</p>
<p>The maximum credit for 2021 is $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for children between 6 and 17. Families can get half of their credit distributed in six monthly payments on July 15, August 13, September 15, October 15, November 15, and December 15.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how and why you may want to opt out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-835" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit.jpg" alt="How to opt-out of child tax credit" width="960" height="643" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit.jpg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit-300x201.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit-768x514.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit-640x429.jpg 640w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-opt-out-of-child-tax-credit-75x50.jpg 75w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<h2><strong>How to opt out of the Child Tax Credit payments?</strong></h2>
<p>Families can opt out of the payments three days before the first Thursday of the month using &#8220;<a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/child-tax-credit-update-portal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:The Child Tax Credit Update Portal">The Child Tax Credit Update Portal</a>,&#8221; so that they can be unenrolled for the respective and following monthly payments.</p>
<p>If you filed your most recent tax return jointly, both you and your spouse must use the portal to unenroll. If only one of you opts out, the other spouse will continue to get half of the joint payments.</p>
<p>If you unenroll, you can&#8217;t opt back in currently. However, that option will be available in the future, according to the IRS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="ue-c-article__subheadline">What can the Child Tax Credit Update Portal be used for?</h2>
<p>The new portal also allows users to change household information, opt out of advance monthly checks and monitor processed payments. Also, users can update personal information such as age, marital status or income or any other change that took place in 2021.</p>
<p>In the event you have been earning a higher or lower salary this year, you should update the IRS so you can receive the correct child tax credit amount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="ue-c-article__subheadline">How can you opt out of advance monthly checks?</h2>
<p>Several people are willing to opt out of advance monthly checks and receive the remainder of the <strong>child tax credit </strong>next year after filling their 2021 tax return.</p>
<p>To do so, you should deregister at least three days before the first Thursday of the month you&#8217;re opting out of. Hence, the next deadline for those interested is October 7 by 21:00 PT or 00:00 ET.</p>
<p>To deregister, you should visit the <strong>Child Tax Credit Update Portal </strong>and choose the &#8216;Manage Advance Payments&#8217; option. Then, you sign in with your IRS username or ID.me account and an option to opt out of the payments will appear.</p>
<h2><strong>Who should consider opting out of the Child Tax Credit payments?</strong></h2>
<p>There are a handful of reasons why you may choose to unenroll from the monthly payments, according to <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link" href="https://money.yahoo.com/opt-out-of-the-monthly-child-credit-tax-payments-191416871.html" data-ylk="slk:tax professionals;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;">tax professionals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you typically owe taxes: </strong>If you typically owe taxes to Uncle Sam and use the CTC to offset what you owe, getting half of your 2021 credit as advance payments may mean a bigger tax bill in April 2022.</p>
<p><strong>If your income increased this year:</strong> An increase in income this year could make you ineligible for the CTC and require you to pay back any advance CTC payments you received. That&#8217;s because the IRS is using your most recent tax return to determine the amount of the credit.</p>
